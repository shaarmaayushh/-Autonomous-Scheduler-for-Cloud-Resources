# -Autonomous-Scheduler-for-Cloud-Resources


## Project Overview

The **Autonomous Scheduler for Cloud Resources** is a cutting-edge solution designed to dynamically allocate, scale, and manage cloud resources based on real-time workload demands. This project leverages advanced data structures to optimize resource utilization, prioritize critical tasks, and ensure scalability and fault tolerance. By simulating a cloud environment, this scheduler demonstrates the significant role data structures play in the efficient management of resources in modern computing infrastructures.

Cloud resource management is vital in today’s world where organizations rely heavily on cloud services for scalable and cost-effective solutions. This project addresses challenges such as over-provisioning, under-utilization, and fault tolerance, making cloud management smarter and more efficient.

## Features

1. **Dynamic Resource Allocation**
   - Assigns resources to incoming tasks based on priority and availability.
   - Ensures efficient resource utilization to avoid wastage or bottlenecks.

2. **Task Prioritization**
   - Manages incoming tasks using a priority queue to ensure critical tasks are handled first.

3. **Auto-Scaling**
   - Dynamically scales resources up or down based on workload and predefined thresholds.

4. **Fault Tolerance**
   - Handles task failures gracefully by re-queuing failed tasks and reallocating resources.

5. **Real-Time Monitoring**
   - Tracks resource utilization and provides actionable insights.
   - Offers visualizations for resource allocation, scaling actions, and task execution.

## How Data Structures Are Used

### 1. **Binary Search Tree (BST)** for Resource Management
   - **Purpose**: Maintains a hierarchy of resources for efficient allocation and deallocation.
   - **How it Works**:
     - Nodes represent individual resources with properties like capacity and availability.
     - Efficient searching and updating of resources in O(log n) time.
   - **Impact**: Ensures quick allocation and tracking of resources, reducing delays.

### 2. **Priority Queue (Heap)** for Task Scheduling
   - **Purpose**: Prioritizes tasks based on criticality and deadlines.
   - **How it Works**:
     - Uses a Min-Heap or Max-Heap to always retrieve the highest-priority task in O(log n) time.
     - Tasks are re-prioritized dynamically based on changing conditions.
   - **Impact**: Guarantees critical tasks are completed on time, improving system reliability.

### 3. **Queue** for Task Retry Mechanism
   - **Purpose**: Ensures fault tolerance by re-queuing failed tasks.
   - **How it Works**:
     - Tasks that fail are pushed into a retry queue with a backoff mechanism to prevent repeated immediate failures.
   - **Impact**: Enhances system robustness and reduces task failures.

### 4. **Min-Heap and Max-Heap** for Auto-Scaling
   - **Purpose**: Dynamically manage resource scaling based on workload metrics.
   - **How it Works**:
     - Min-Heap identifies underutilized resources for scaling down.
     - Max-Heap prioritizes adding resources when the system is overloaded.
   - **Impact**: Minimizes cost and ensures resources are available when needed.
